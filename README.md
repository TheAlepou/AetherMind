# **AetherMind**   
*A test project where I create an OpenAI-powered robotics system using Arduino or a computer-based platform.*  

## **What is AetherMind?**  
AetherMind is an experimental AI robotics project where I integrate OpenAI’s API into a **computer-based AI system** and eventually **an Arduino-powered robot.**  

The first prototype, **Klaus**, is designed to have:  
**Memory persistence** – Stores and recalls previous conversations.  
**Conversational AI** – Uses OpenAI’s API to generate responses.  
**Future expansion** – Potential for **360° vision**, **real-world mobility**, and **voice interaction.**

## **How to Use Klaus (First Prototype)**  
### **Requirements:**  
1️. **An OpenAI API key**  
2️. **A `.env` file containing the API key**
3. **requirments.txt**  

### **Setup Instructions:**  
1. **Clone this repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AetherMind.git
   cd AetherMind
   ```  
2. **Install dependencies:**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
3. **Create a `.env` file:**  
   - Open a text editor and create a new file named `.env`  
   - Add the following line (replace with your actual API key):  
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```  
   - Save the file.
4. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```run 
   pip install -r requirements.txt for the dependencies to install
   ```
5. **Run Klaus:**  
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## **Future Plans & Roadmap**  
**Basic AI conversation system** *(Completed!)*  
**Basic Arduino implementation system** *(Completed!)*   
**Experiment with webcam, microphone, and speakers** *(In Progress)*  
**Integrate a 360° camera for full environmental awareness** *(Planned)*  
**Potential future integration with Arduino for mobility** *(Long-Term Goal)*
